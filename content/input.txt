Title: Zapier Too Expensive? The Honest Alternative for Small Business (Make.com Review)
Type: comparison

Introduction: If you're paying $50–$100 a month for Zapier and quietly wondering whether you're getting your money's worth, you're not alone. This guide won't tell you to cancel Zapier immediately — it will give you honest math so you can decide for yourself.

Why Zapier Gets Expensive for Small Business

Zapier pricing is based on "tasks" — every individual action your automation performs counts as one task toward your monthly limit. On the surface, 2,000 tasks for $19.99/month sounds generous. The reality hits when you build a real workflow. A simple automation that receives a Facebook lead, adds it to Google Sheets, sends a Slack notification, and emails your sales team counts as 4 tasks — for a single lead. If you receive 200 leads per month, that's 800 tasks from one workflow alone. Most small businesses hit the ceiling within 60 days and upgrade to the $49/month Professional plan without fully understanding why.

Make.com Pricing Explained (Simple Math)

Make.com charges for "operations" instead of tasks, but the key difference is pricing structure. The Core plan at $9/month includes 10,000 operations. The same Facebook lead workflow — 200 leads, 4 steps each — runs comfortably on Make.com Core with room for 5-6 additional automations of similar complexity. For a small business running 3-5 active workflows, the monthly difference is typically $30-70. Over 12 months that's $360-840 saved.

Table: Real Cost Comparison: Zapier vs Make.com
Workflow|Zapier Tasks/mo|Make Operations/mo|Zapier Cost|Make Cost
Facebook leads → Sheets → Slack → Email|800|800|$49/mo|$9/mo
Gmail → Drive + rename file|400|400|$49/mo|$9/mo
Calendly → Google Calendar + Slack alert|300|300|$49/mo|$9/mo
3 workflows combined|1,500|1,500|$49/mo|$9/mo

Tech Tip: Before switching, check your Zapier dashboard for "Tasks Used" in the current month. If you're consistently above 80% of your plan limit, Make.com will almost certainly cost you less for the same workflows.

When Zapier Is Still the Better Choice

Zapier is not a bad product — stay on it if any of these apply. You use niche apps that Make.com doesn't support: Zapier connects 7,000+ apps versus Make.com's 2,400+. If your CRM or industry-specific software only has a Zapier integration, switching creates more problems than it solves. Your workflows are simple and your team built them — Make.com has a steeper learning curve and that comfort has real value. You're running fewer than 3 workflows and rarely hit task limits — the $30 monthly saving doesn't justify migration time.

When Make.com Saves You Real Money

Make.com becomes the clear winner when you run multi-step workflows with 4+ actions, process high volumes of data, or want visual control over your workflows. Make.com's drag-and-drop scenario builder shows you exactly how data flows between apps — useful when something breaks and you need to debug quickly. If you're just starting out, Make.com's free plan includes 1,000 operations monthly — enough to validate 2-3 workflows before spending anything.

Workflow Steps: How to Switch from Zapier to Make.com in One Weekend
1. Log into Zapier and identify your highest-task workflow — the one consuming the most monthly tasks
2. Create a free Make.com account at make.com — no credit card required
3. Rebuild that one workflow in Make.com using the visual drag-and-drop builder
4. Run both Zapier and Make.com versions in parallel for one week
5. Confirm Make.com delivers identical results
6. Pause the Zapier version and monitor for two additional weeks
7. Once confident, migrate your remaining workflows one by one over 2-3 weekends

Verdict: Zapier is not a bad product — it's easier for beginners and connects 7,000+ apps. But if you're hitting task limits regularly and running workflows with 4+ steps, Make.com will almost certainly save you $360-840 per year for identical results. Rebuild one workflow on Make.com's free plan this weekend and see for yourself.

A: In most multi-step workflows, yes — typically 50-80% less per month. The biggest savings come when you have 4+ step workflows running at high volume.

Title: How to Automatically Send Facebook and Instagram Leads to Google Sheets
Type: how-to

Introduction: Every time someone fills out your Facebook or Instagram lead ad form, that lead sits in Meta's system waiting for you to manually download a CSV. By the time you respond, your competitor already called them. This guide shows how to get every new lead into Google Sheets automatically — in real time, no CSV downloads, no manual work.

Why Manual Lead Export Is Killing Your Conversion Rate

Speed to lead is the single biggest factor in converting paid ad leads. Most businesses respond within 2-24 hours because they check Meta's Lead Center manually once or twice a day. Research consistently shows that responding within 5 minutes makes you 9x more likely to convert a lead than responding within an hour. When you're paying $5-20 per lead on Facebook or Instagram ads, slow follow-up is the most expensive mistake you can make. The math is simple: if you spend $500/month on ads and convert 10% of leads, automating follow-up to under 5 minutes can realistically double that conversion rate — turning $500 in ad spend into twice the revenue without spending an extra dollar.

What This Automation Does

Every time someone submits your Facebook or Instagram lead ad form, Make.com instantly catches that event and adds a new row to your Google Sheet — name, email, phone number, and any custom fields from your form. Your sales team sees it in real time. No downloading, no importing, no delay. The automation runs 24/7 including nights and weekends when your team is offline — leads that come in at 11pm are in your sheet by 11:00:01pm.

Table: What Gets Captured Automatically
Form Field|Google Sheets Column|Example Value
First Name|A: Name|Sarah Johnson
Email Address|B: Email|sarah@company.com
Phone Number|C: Phone|+1 555 0123
Ad Name|D: Source|Summer Promo 2026
Submission Time|E: Timestamp|2026-02-20 14:32

Tech Tip: Add a Slack notification as a third step in Make.com — when a new row hits your Google Sheet, Slack pings your sales channel instantly. Response time drops from hours to minutes. Make.com's free plan handles this three-step scenario easily.

Workflow Steps: How to Connect Facebook Lead Ads to Google Sheets
1. Create a free Make.com account — no credit card required
2. Click "Create a new scenario" and add Facebook Lead Ads as your trigger module
3. Connect your Facebook account and select the Ad Account and the specific Form you want to watch
4. Click the + button to add a second module — search for Google Sheets and select "Add a Row"
5. Connect your Google account and select the spreadsheet and sheet where leads should land
6. Map the fields: drag Name → Name column, Email → Email column, Phone → Phone column
7. Optionally add a third module: search Slack and select "Send a Message" — map the lead name and email into the message
8. Click "Run once" to test — submit a test lead via your Facebook form and confirm it appears in Sheets within seconds
9. Turn the scenario ON — every new lead now lands in your spreadsheet automatically

Verdict: If you're spending money on Facebook or Instagram ads and still downloading leads manually, you're paying twice — once for the lead and again in lost conversions from slow follow-up. This automation takes 20 minutes to set up once and runs forever. Make.com's free plan covers up to 1,000 operations per month, enough for most small businesses running lead gen campaigns. When you scale, the Core plan at $9/month handles thousands of leads.

FAQ:
Q: Does this work with Instagram lead ads too?
A: Yes — Facebook and Instagram lead ads share the same Meta Ads infrastructure. The Facebook Lead Ads module in Make.com captures leads from both platforms automatically.
Q: What if someone submits a lead while Make.com is not running?
A: Make.com checks for new leads on a schedule you set — every 15 minutes on the free plan, instantly on paid plans. Leads submitted between checks are queued and processed on the next run, nothing is lost.
Q: Do I need a developer to set this up?
A: No. Make.com's visual drag-and-drop builder requires no coding. If you can use Google Sheets, you can build this automation.
Q: What happens if my Google Sheet is full or the file is moved?
A: Make.com will log an error and stop the scenario — you'll get an email notification so you can fix it before losing any leads.
