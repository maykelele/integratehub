Title: Zapier Too Expensive? The Honest Alternative for Small Business (Make.com Review)
Type: comparison

Introduction: If you're paying $50–$100 a month for Zapier and quietly wondering whether you're getting your money's worth, you're not alone. This guide won't tell you to cancel Zapier immediately — it will give you honest math so you can decide for yourself.

H2: Why Zapier Gets Expensive for Small Business

Zapier pricing is based on "tasks" — every individual action your automation performs counts as one task toward your monthly limit. On the surface, 2,000 tasks for $19.99/month sounds generous. The reality hits when you build a real workflow. A simple automation that receives a Facebook lead, adds it to Google Sheets, sends a Slack notification, and emails your sales team counts as 4 tasks — for a single lead. If you receive 200 leads per month, that's 800 tasks from one workflow alone. Most small businesses hit the task limits quickly and upgrade to higher Professional plan tiers, which can reach $49/month or more depending on usage.

H2: Make.com Pricing Explained (Simple Math)

Pricing verified February 2026 based on official Zapier and Make.com pricing pages.

Make.com charges for "operations" instead of tasks, but the key difference is pricing structure. The Core plan at $9/month includes 10,000 operations. The same Facebook lead workflow — 200 leads, 4 steps each — runs comfortably on Make.com Core with room for 5-6 additional automations of similar complexity. For a small business running 3-5 active workflows, the monthly difference is typically $30-70. Over 12 months that's $360-840 saved.

Table: Real Cost Comparison: Zapier vs Make.com
Workflow|Zapier Tasks/mo|Make Operations/mo|Zapier Cost|Make Cost
Facebook leads → Sheets → Slack → Email|800|800|$19.99–$69/mo depending on task tier|$9/mo
Gmail → Drive + rename file|400|400|$19.99–$69/mo depending on task tier|$9/mo
Calendly → Google Calendar + Slack alert|300|300|$19.99–$69/mo depending on task tier|$9/mo
3 workflows combined|1,500|1,500|$19.99–$69/mo depending on task tier|$9/mo

Tech Tip: Before switching, check your Zapier dashboard for "Tasks Used" in the current month. If you're consistently above 80% of your plan limit, Make.com will almost certainly cost you less for the same workflows.

H2: When Zapier Is Still the Better Choice

Zapier is not a bad product — stay on it if any of these apply. You use niche apps that Make.com doesn't support: Zapier connects 7,000+ apps versus Make.com's 2,400+. If your CRM or industry-specific software only has a Zapier integration, switching creates more problems than it solves. Your workflows are simple and your team built them — Make.com has a steeper learning curve and that comfort has real value. You're running fewer than 3 workflows and rarely hit task limits — the $30 monthly saving doesn't justify migration time.

H2: When Make.com Saves You Real Money

Make.com becomes the clear winner when you run multi-step workflows with 4+ actions, process high volumes of data, or want visual control over your workflows. Make.com's drag-and-drop scenario builder shows you exactly how data flows between apps — useful when something breaks and you need to debug quickly. If you're just starting out, Make.com's free plan includes 1,000 operations monthly — enough to validate 2-3 workflows before spending anything.

Workflow Steps: How to Switch from Zapier to Make.com in One Weekend
1. Log into Zapier and identify your highest-task workflow — the one consuming the most monthly tasks
2. Create a free Make.com account at make.com — no credit card required
3. Rebuild that one workflow in Make.com using the visual drag-and-drop builder
4. Run both Zapier and Make.com versions in parallel for one week
5. Confirm Make.com delivers identical results
6. Pause the Zapier version and monitor for two additional weeks
7. Once confident, migrate your remaining workflows one by one over 2-3 weekends

Verdict: Zapier is not a bad product — it's easier for beginners and connects 7,000+ apps. But if you're hitting task limits regularly and running workflows with 4+ steps, Make.com will almost certainly save you $360-840 per year for identical results. Rebuild one workflow on Make.com's free plan this weekend and see for yourself.

FAQ:
Q: Is Make.com cheaper than Zapier?
A: In most multi-step workflows, yes — typically 50-80% less per month. The biggest savings come when you have 4+ step workflows running at high volume.
Q: Is Make.com harder to use than Zapier?
A: Slightly at first. Zapier is more linear and beginner-friendly. Make.com has a visual canvas that becomes easier once you learn it — most users feel comfortable within a few days.
Q: Can Make.com replace Zapier completely?
A: For most small business workflows, yes. The only exception is if you rely on apps that Make.com doesn't support — check make.com/en/integrations before switching.
Q: What happens to my Zapier automations if I switch?
A: Nothing — they keep running until you manually pause them. You can migrate one workflow at a time and run both platforms in parallel during the transition.

Slug: facebook-instagram-leads-google-sheets-automation
Title: How to Automatically Send Facebook and Instagram Leads to Google Sheets
Type: how-to

Introduction: Every time someone fills out your Facebook or Instagram lead ad form, that lead sits in Meta's system waiting for you to manually download a CSV. By the time you respond, your competitor already called them. This guide shows how to get every new lead into Google Sheets automatically — in real time, no CSV downloads, no manual work.

H2: Why Manual Lead Export Is Killing Your Conversion Rate

Speed to lead is the single biggest factor in converting paid ad leads. Most businesses respond within 2-24 hours because they check Meta's Lead Center manually once or twice a day. Research consistently shows that responding within 5 minutes makes you 9x more likely to convert a lead than responding within an hour. When you're paying $5-20 per lead on Facebook or Instagram ads, slow follow-up is the most expensive mistake you can make.

H2: What This Automation Does

Every time someone submits your Facebook or Instagram lead ad form, Make.com instantly catches that event and adds a new row to your Google Sheet — name, email, phone number, and the ad name so you know which campaign generated the lead. Your sales team sees it in real time. No downloading, no importing, no delay.

Image: assets/screenshots/screenshot-facebook-leads-1.png|Make.com scenario editor — empty canvas ready to build

Table: What Gets Captured Automatically
Form Field|Google Sheets Column|Example Value
First Name + Last Name|A: Name|Sarah Johnson
Email Address|B: Email|sarah@company.com
Phone Number|C: Phone|+1 555 0123
Ad Name|D: Source|Summer Promo 2026
Submission Time|E: Date|2026-02-20

Tech Tip: Add a Slack notification as a third step in Make.com — when a new row hits your Google Sheet, Slack pings your sales channel instantly. Response time drops from hours to minutes — and that directly impacts your conversion rate.

Workflow Steps: How to Connect Facebook Lead Ads to Google Sheets
1. Create a free Make.com account — no credit card required. Click "Create a new scenario" on your dashboard.
2. Click the large purple + button on the canvas and search for "Facebook Lead Ads" — select "Watch Leads" as your trigger

Image: assets/screenshots/screenshot-facebook-leads-2.png|Facebook Lead Ads module — click Create a connection to link your Facebook account

3. Click "Create a connection", name it anything (e.g. "My Facebook connection"), click Save — Facebook OAuth will open automatically
4. Once connected, select your Facebook Page and the Lead Ad Form you want to watch

Image: assets/screenshots/screenshot-facebook-leads-3.png|Facebook Lead Ads configuration — Connection and Page selection

5. Click the + button on the right of the Facebook module to add a second module — search for "Google Sheets" and select "Add a Row"
6. Connect your Google account and select the spreadsheet where leads should land — choose "Search by path" and select your file

Image: assets/screenshots/screenshot-facebook-leads-4.png|Google Sheets module connected to Facebook Lead Ads in the scenario canvas

7. Map the fields from Facebook to your Sheet columns — drag Full name to Name column, Email to Email column, Phone number to Phone column, Ad name to Source column, Date created to Date column

Image: assets/screenshots/screenshot-facebook-leads-5.png|Field mapping — Facebook lead data mapped to Google Sheets columns

8. Click Save — Make.com will ask "From which point do you want to start?" — select "From now on" to capture only new leads going forward
9. Click "Run once" to activate, then turn the scenario ON — the toggle at the bottom of the canvas

Image: assets/screenshots/screenshot-facebook-leads-7.png|Completed Google Sheet with live lead data — Name, Email, Phone, Source and Date columns populated automatically

Verdict: If you're spending money on Facebook or Instagram ads and still downloading leads manually, you're paying twice — once for the lead and again in lost conversions from slow follow-up. This automation takes 20 minutes to set up once and runs forever. Make.com's free plan covers up to 1,000 operations per month, enough for most small businesses running lead gen campaigns. When you scale, the Core plan at $9/month handles thousands of leads.

FAQ:
Q: Does this work with Instagram lead ads too?
A: Yes — Facebook and Instagram lead ads share the same Meta Ads infrastructure. The Facebook Lead Ads module in Make.com captures leads from both platforms automatically.
Q: What if someone submits a lead while Make.com is not running?
A: Make.com checks for new leads on a schedule — every 15 minutes on the free plan, in real time on paid plans. Leads submitted between checks are queued and processed on the next run, nothing is lost.
Q: Do I need a developer to set this up?
A: No. Make.com's visual drag-and-drop builder requires no coding. If you can use Google Sheets, you can build this automation.
Q: What does "From now on" mean when setting up the trigger?
A: Make.com asks from which point to start processing leads. "From now on" means only new leads submitted after you activate the scenario will be captured. Choose "All" only if you want to import existing leads retroactively.

Slug: stripe-payment-failed-automation
Title: Stripe Payment Failed? Automatically Alert Your Team and Email the Customer Instantly
Type: how-to

Introduction: A payment fails in Stripe. The customer never hears from you. Two days later they cancel. This happens constantly — because Stripe logs the failure and moves on, and nobody is watching the dashboard 24/7. This guide shows you how to build an automation that reacts the moment a payment fails: the customer gets an email within seconds, and your team gets an alert. No developer needed, no manual checking.

H2: Why Missed Failed Payments Cost You More Than You Think

Every failed payment that goes unaddressed is a potential churn. Customers don't always know their card failed — they assume you'll reach out. When you don't, they assume the worst and move on. Speed matters: a same-day email from you reads as professional and attentive. A silence that lasts three days reads as a company that doesn't care. The good news is this is completely fixable with a simple automation. Once it's set up, it runs forever.

H2: Doesn't Stripe Already Send Failed Payment Emails?

Yes — but with important limitations that make it the wrong solution for most businesses. Stripe's built-in Smart Retries and dunning emails only work for subscription billing (recurring charges). If you send one-time invoices, Stripe won't automatically email your customer at all. Even for subscriptions, the emails are generic Stripe-branded messages that many customers confuse with spam or phishing. You can't add your logo, your tone, or a direct link to update payment details in your own portal. And critically — your team gets no alert. Nobody on your side knows a payment failed unless they check the Stripe dashboard manually. The automation in this guide solves all of that: it works for every invoice type, sends email from your own Gmail account, and notifies your team the same second it fires.

H2: What This Automation Does

When a payment fails in Stripe, Make.com catches the event instantly and runs three actions automatically: it identifies the customer, sends them a personalized email with their invoice details, and your team can add a Slack alert so someone can follow up if needed.

Table: How the Workflow Runs
Step|What Happens|Tool
1|Stripe detects a failed invoice payment|Stripe Webhook
2|Make.com retrieves the customer name and email|Stripe Retrieve a Customer
3|Customer receives a personalized email with invoice details|Gmail

The whole setup takes about 20 minutes. After that, it runs on its own.

Workflow Steps: How to Set Up the Automation

1. Create a Stripe account and add a test customer — open Stripe, go to Billing → Invoices, and create a test invoice. You'll use Stripe's sandbox mode throughout this guide, so no real payments are involved.

Image: assets/screenshots/screenshot-stripe-reminders-1.png|Stripe sandbox dashboard showing an open invoice for a test customer

2. Log in to Make.com and create a new scenario — click the large + button on the canvas and search for "Stripe." Select the Watch Events module. This is the trigger that listens to your Stripe account.

Image: assets/screenshots/screenshot-stripe-reminders-2.png|Make.com scenario canvas with the Stripe Watch Events module and Create a webhook button

3. Click "Create a webhook" — Make.com will ask you to connect your Stripe account. Use API Key authentication: copy your Secret key from Stripe → Developers → API keys (it starts with sk_test_ for sandbox). Set the Group to "Invoice" and check "Invoice payment failed" as the event to watch.

Image: assets/screenshots/screenshot-stripe-reminders-3.png|Webhook configuration showing Invoice group with Invoice payment failed event selected

4. Add a filter between your Stripe trigger and the next module — click the line between modules and select "Add a filter." Set the label to "Invoice Payment Failed," the condition to Event Type, the operator to Equal to, and the value to invoice.payment_failed. This prevents the workflow from running on unrelated Stripe events.

Image: assets/screenshots/screenshot-stripe-reminders-4.png|Make.com filter setup with condition Event Type equal to invoice.payment_failed

5. Add a Stripe "Retrieve a Customer" module — click the + button and search for Stripe again. Select "Retrieve a Customer." This step is essential: when Stripe sends a payment failed event, it includes the customer's ID but not their name or email. This module fetches the full customer profile.

Image: assets/screenshots/screenshot-stripe-reminders-5.png|Make.com module picker showing Stripe Retrieve a Customer option

6. Map the Customer ID field to the customer object from your Stripe trigger — in the Retrieve a Customer configuration, set Customer ID to "2. Object: Customer" from the previous module. This tells Make.com which customer to look up.

Image: assets/screenshots/screenshot-stripe-reminders-6.png|Retrieve a Customer module with Customer ID mapped to the Stripe event data

7. Add a Gmail "Send an email" module — click + and add Gmail. Connect your Google account when prompted. Map the To field to "7. Email" from the Retrieve a Customer module. For the Subject, type "Payment Failed: Invoice" and then map "2. Object: Number" so each email shows the real invoice number.

Image: assets/screenshots/screenshot-stripe-reminders-7.png|Gmail module showing connection setup with To, Subject and Body fields

8. Map the email body with dynamic fields — in the Body field, write your message and map three fields from Stripe: the customer's name (7. Name), the invoice amount (2. Object: Amount due), and the invoice number (2. Object: Number). The result is a personalized email that looks like it was written by hand.

Image: assets/screenshots/screenshot-stripe-reminders-8.png|Gmail module with To field mapped to customer email and Subject with invoice number

Image: assets/screenshots/screenshot-stripe-reminders-9.png|Gmail body showing dynamic fields mapped — customer name, payment amount, and invoice number

9. Save the scenario — your canvas should now show three modules connected: Stripe Watch Events → Stripe Retrieve a Customer → Gmail Send an email.

Image: assets/screenshots/screenshot-stripe-reminders-10.png|Complete Make.com scenario canvas showing all three modules connected

10. Test the workflow — use the Stripe CLI to send a test event without touching any real data. Run stripe trigger invoice.payment_failed in your terminal. Make.com will process it and send the email to your test customer automatically. If you don't have the Stripe CLI, install it with brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe on Mac, then run stripe login first.

Image: assets/screenshots/screenshot-stripe-reminders-11.png|Email inbox showing Payment Failed invoice email received instantly with customer name and invoice number

Tech Tip: After the Gmail module, add a Slack "Create a Message" module to alert your billing channel the moment a payment fails. Something like: "Payment failed — [Customer Name], Invoice [Number], Amount: [Amount Due]. Follow up today." Now both the customer and your team know immediately — and someone can pick up the phone if the customer doesn't respond to the automated email.

Verdict: Failed payments are one of the most preventable forms of revenue loss for small businesses. Stripe's built-in emails only cover subscriptions and arrive as generic Stripe-branded messages — this automation works for every invoice type, sends email from your own account, and alerts your team in the same instant. It takes under 30 minutes to build and runs forever without maintenance.

FAQ:
Q: Do I need a paid Stripe account to set this up?
A: No. You can build and test the entire workflow using Stripe's sandbox mode, which is free. When you're ready to go live, switch to your live Stripe API key and the automation works identically.
Q: What if the same payment fails multiple times?
A: Stripe sends a new event each time a payment attempt fails. Your Make.com scenario will fire each time, sending a new email. If you want to limit notifications to one per invoice, add a Make.com data store to track which invoices have already triggered an alert.
Q: Does this work for subscription renewals, not just one-time invoices?
A: Yes. The invoice.payment_failed event covers both subscription renewals and one-time invoice payments. Any failed charge that generates a Stripe invoice will trigger this workflow.
Q: Do I need a paid Make.com plan?
A: The free Make.com plan includes 1,000 operations per month. Each time this scenario runs, it uses 3 operations — one per module. For most small businesses, the free plan is more than enough to get started.

Slug: calendly-booking-onboarding-checklist-automation
Title: Calendly Automation: Create an Onboarding Checklist and Notify Your Team Instantly
Type: how-to

Introduction: Someone books a call through your Calendly link. Then nothing happens — no checklist, no team alert, no preparation. You show up to the call scrambling for context. This guide shows you how to build a Calendly automation that triggers the moment someone books: their details land in a Google Sheet as an onboarding checklist, and your team gets a Slack notification instantly. No code, no manual work, runs forever once set up.

H2: Why Manual Booking Follow-Up Costs You Clients

Every Calendly booking is a potential client signaling interest — and the window between booking and the actual call is where most freelancers and agencies drop the ball. Without a system, nobody prepares materials, nobody reviews the prospect's background, and the call starts cold. The result: you look disorganized, the prospect feels like a number, and your close rate suffers. The fix takes 25 minutes to build and handles every booking automatically from that point forward.

H2: Doesn't Calendly Already Have Built-In Automations?

Yes — Calendly has a "Workflows" feature that can send automatic emails and SMS messages before and after meetings. It's useful for basic reminders and follow-ups. But it has real limitations that matter for onboarding. Calendly Workflows can only send emails and SMS — there's no way to create a Google Sheet row, build a checklist, or notify your team in Slack. The messages are Calendly-branded templates with limited customization. And there's no central tracker where your team can see all upcoming bookings with preparation status. If all you need is a reminder email, Calendly Workflows work fine. But if you want a structured onboarding process — checklist, team alerts, centralized tracking — you need Make.com to connect the tools Calendly can't reach.

H2: Why Use Make.com for Calendly Automation

Make.com connects Calendly to 2,400+ apps with a visual drag-and-drop builder — no code required. For this workflow, the key advantages over doing it manually or using Zapier are clear. Pricing: Make.com's free plan includes 1,000 operations per month. This scenario uses 4 operations per booking, covering 250 bookings monthly at zero cost. On Zapier, the same workflow would require the $49/month Professional plan within weeks. Visual builder: Make.com shows you exactly how data flows between Calendly, Google Sheets, and Slack. When something breaks, you can see where and fix it in seconds. Flexibility: need to add a step later — like sending a welcome email or creating a Google Drive folder? Just click + and add a module. The scenario grows with your business.

H2: What This Automation Does

When someone books a meeting through Calendly, Make.com catches the event instantly and runs three actions: it fetches the full event details, adds a new row to your Google Sheet with the invitee's name, email, event type, scheduled time, and a pre-built onboarding checklist — then sends a Slack message to your team channel so someone can start preparing immediately.

CTA: You can build this entire automation using Make.com's free plan in about 25 minutes — no credit card required.

Table: What Gets Captured Automatically
Field|Google Sheets Column|Example Value
Invitee Name|A: Name|Sarah Johnson
Invitee Email|B: Email|sarah@company.com
Event Type|C: Event Type|Discovery Call
Scheduled Date & Time|D: Date & Time|2026-02-26 15:30
Status|E: Status|New
Onboarding Tasks|F: Onboarding Tasks|Send welcome email, Prepare docs, Assign team member

H2: Don't Use Slack? Alternatives That Work the Same Way

This guide uses Slack for team notifications, but Make.com supports any messaging tool. If your team doesn't use Slack, swap the last module for one of these — the rest of the workflow stays identical. Gmail: send a notification email to your team instead. Microsoft Teams: same concept as Slack, select the Teams module and pick your channel. Google Chat: if you're already in Google Workspace, this is the simplest swap.

Workflow Steps: How to Build the Calendly Onboarding Automation

1. Create a free Make.com account — no credit card required. Click "Create a new scenario" on your dashboard.

2. Click the large + button on the canvas and search for "Calendly" — you'll see it listed as a verified integration with several module options. Select "Watch Events" as your trigger.

Image: assets/screenshots/screenshot-calendly-onboarding-01.png|Calendly module picker — select Watch Events as the trigger

3. Click "Create a webhook" — Make.com will open a configuration dialog. Name your webhook (e.g. "My Calendly Event webhook") and click "Create a connection" to link your Calendly account.

Image: assets/screenshots/screenshot-calendly-onboarding-02.png|Calendly Watch Events module with Create a webhook button

4. Once your Calendly connection is established, you'll see the webhook configuration. Click "Create a connection" and authorize Make.com to access your Calendly account through OAuth.

Image: assets/screenshots/screenshot-calendly-onboarding-03.png|Webhook creation dialog — Create a connection to link your Calendly account

5. After connecting, configure the webhook: check "Invitee Created" under Events (this triggers when someone books a meeting). Select your Organization URI from the dropdown — this tells Make.com which Calendly account to watch.

Image: assets/screenshots/screenshot-calendly-onboarding-04.png|Webhook configuration — Connection established, Events and Organization URI fields visible

Image: assets/screenshots/screenshot-calendly-onboarding-05.png|Webhook configured — Invitee Created checked and Organization URI selected

6. Add a second Calendly module — click the + button to the right of Watch Events and search for Calendly again. Select "Get an Event." This module fetches the full event details including the scheduled start time, which the Watch Events trigger doesn't include. Map the Event field from the trigger to the Event URI input.

7. Add a Google Sheets module — click the + button after the Get an Event module, search for "Google Sheets" and select "Add a Row."

Image: assets/screenshots/screenshot-calendly-onboarding-06.png|Google Sheets module picker — select Add a Row

8. Connect your Google account, set Search Method to "Search by path", select My Drive, and choose your "Calendly Onboarding Tracker" spreadsheet.

Image: assets/screenshots/screenshot-calendly-onboarding-07.png|Google Sheets connection — Search by path, My Drive, click to choose spreadsheet

Image: assets/screenshots/screenshot-calendly-onboarding-08.png|Google Sheets configured — Calendly Onboarding Tracker spreadsheet selected with Sheet1

9. Map the fields from Calendly to your Google Sheet columns — Name from the Watch Events module maps to column A, Email to column B, Event to column C, Start Time from the Get an Event module to column D. Type "New" manually in the Status field and "Send welcome email, Prepare docs, Assign team member" in the Onboarding Tasks field.

Image: assets/screenshots/screenshot-calendly-onboarding-10.png|Field mapping — Calendly data mapped to Google Sheets columns with static onboarding tasks

Tech Tip: The Watch Events trigger provides basic invitee data (Name, Email, Event URI), but Start Time comes from the Get an Event module. That's why we need both Calendly modules — the trigger catches the booking, and Get an Event fetches the scheduling details.

10. Add a Slack module — click the + button after Google Sheets, search for "Slack" and select "Send a Message."

Image: assets/screenshots/screenshot-calendly-onboarding-11.png|Module picker showing Slack — select Send a Message

11. Click "Create a connection" to link your Slack workspace. Authorize Make.com when prompted.

Image: assets/screenshots/screenshot-calendly-onboarding-12.png|Slack module — Create a connection to authorize your workspace

12. Configure the Slack message — select your channel (e.g. #all-new-bookings), set Channel type to "Public channel", and compose your notification message.

Image: assets/screenshots/screenshot-calendly-onboarding-13.png|Slack configuration — channel set to all-new-bookings, Public channel type, Text field ready

13. Write the Slack notification text using mapped fields — include the invitee name, email, event type, and start time. Add a link to your Google Sheet so your team can check the onboarding tracker immediately.

Image: assets/screenshots/screenshot-calendly-onboarding-14.png|Slack message body with mapped fields — New Booking notification with Name, Email, Event, Date and tracker link

14. Save the scenario and click "Run once" — then book a test meeting through your own Calendly link using an incognito browser window. Make.com will process the event and populate your Google Sheet automatically.

Image: assets/screenshots/screenshot-calendly-onboarding-15.png|Google Sheet populated with test booking data — Name, Email, Event Type, Date, Status and Onboarding Tasks

15. Check your Slack channel — the notification arrives within seconds of the booking, with all the details your team needs to start preparing.

Image: assets/screenshots/screenshot-calendly-onboarding-16.png|Slack notification received in #all-new-bookings channel with booking details and tracker link

16. Your completed scenario should show four connected modules: Calendly Watch Events → Calendly Get an Event → Google Sheets Add a Row → Slack Send a Message. Toggle the scenario ON to run it automatically for every new booking.

Image: assets/screenshots/screenshot-calendly-onboarding-17.png|Complete Make.com scenario — four modules connected and running successfully

Tech Tip: The Event Type field currently shows a Calendly API URL instead of a human-readable name like "Discovery Call." To fix this, add a Calendly "Get an Event Type" module between Get an Event and Google Sheets — it converts the URI into the actual event type name. For most setups this is optional since you'll recognize your own event types, but it makes the Google Sheet cleaner.

H2: Who Should Use This Automation

This workflow is built for anyone who uses Calendly for client-facing bookings and wants a structured preparation process. Freelancers using Calendly for discovery calls or project kickoffs. Agencies onboarding new clients through scheduled intake meetings. Consultants managing multiple bookings across different service types. Small business owners scheduling sales calls and demos. If you book more than 5 calls per week and prepare for each one manually, this automation pays for itself in time saved within the first week.

H2: Apps Used in This Automation

This workflow connects four tools, all of which have free tiers. Calendly captures the booking and sends the event data. Make.com orchestrates the entire workflow — it's the engine that connects everything. Google Sheets stores the onboarding tracker with booking details and checklists. Slack delivers instant team notifications so someone can start preparing immediately.

Verdict: If you're using Calendly for client bookings and still preparing for calls manually, you're wasting time on every single booking. Calendly's built-in Workflows can send reminder emails, but they can't build checklists, update spreadsheets, or alert your team in Slack. This automation captures every new booking in a structured Google Sheet with a pre-built checklist and alerts your team instantly. It takes about 25 minutes to build, costs nothing on Make.com's free plan (each run uses 4 operations — well within the 1,000 monthly limit), and runs automatically from that point forward.

FAQ:
Q: Does this work with Calendly's free plan?
A: Yes. Calendly's free plan supports webhook integrations through Make.com. You can use this automation with any Calendly tier.
Q: What if someone cancels or reschedules their booking?
A: The Watch Events trigger supports both "Invitee Created" and "Invitee Cancelled" events. You can add a second scenario that updates the Google Sheet status to "Cancelled" when someone cancels — or handle both events in one scenario with a filter.
Q: Why do I need the "Get an Event" module — can't Watch Events provide all the data?
A: Watch Events provides the invitee's name, email, and a reference to the event, but not the scheduled start time. The Get an Event module fetches the full event details including when the meeting is actually scheduled.
Q: Can I customize the onboarding checklist for different event types?
A: Yes. Add a Make.com Router module after Get an Event — route different event types to different Google Sheets rows with customized task lists. For example, "Discovery Call" gets one checklist while "Onboarding Session" gets another.
Q: Do I need a paid Make.com plan?
A: The free plan includes 1,000 operations per month. Each time this scenario runs, it uses 4 operations — one per module. That covers 250 bookings per month, more than enough for most freelancers and small agencies.

If you don’t have a developer on your team and want to automate standard business workflows — lead capture, client onboarding, payment alerts, team notifications — choose Make.com. You’ll likely build your first automation within 30 minutes and everything runs in the cloud with no infrastructure setup.

If you have a developer, need to self-host for data privacy or compliance reasons, or want maximum flexibility and control, choose n8n. It’s powerful, but it assumes technical setup and ongoing maintenance.

Still not sure? Read the full breakdown below — it covers pricing, ease of use, and a real-world workflow comparison so you can decide based on your actual situation.

H2: The Core Difference in 30 Seconds

Make.com is a cloud-hosted, visual no-code automation platform designed for people who want to connect apps without writing code. You sign up, drag and drop modules, and your workflow runs in the cloud.

n8n is an open-source automation platform that can be self-hosted on your own server or used as a cloud service. It’s powerful and flexible — but it often assumes you’re comfortable with APIs, JSON, webhooks, or basic infrastructure concepts. If you’re a freelancer, agency owner, or small business operator without a developer on the team, this difference matters more than any pricing comparison.

H2: What “Non-Technical” Actually Means in This Context

Both platforms say “no-code,” but the real test is simple: can you build a working automation without troubleshooting technical errors?

On Make.com, connecting Calendly to Google Sheets means searching for “Calendly,” choosing a trigger like “Watch Events,” authorizing with OAuth, and mapping fields visually — Name goes to Name, Email goes to Email. If something fails, errors are usually actionable (for example: re-authorize your account).

On n8n, the same connection may involve webhook setup, using an expression editor, or debugging API-style errors. n8n has strong documentation and a visual builder, but troubleshooting often assumes more technical familiarity. This isn’t a criticism — it’s a statement of who each tool is optimized for.

If you’re a marketing agency owner, a freelance consultant, or a small business operator — and automation isn’t your full-time job — this usability gap is the single most important factor in your decision.

H2: Pricing Breakdown — Verified March 2026

Pricing verified February 2026 based on official Make.com and n8n pricing pages. Both platforms update pricing periodically, so check the official sites for the latest details.

Make.com uses an operation-based model. Each module step that runs counts as one operation. A 4-step workflow running once uses 4 operations. The free plan includes 1,000 operations per month. The Core plan starts at $9/month (billed annually) and includes 10,000 operations per month — enough for most small businesses running several active workflows.

n8n Cloud uses an execution-based model. One execution equals one complete workflow run, regardless of how many steps it contains. n8n Cloud plans start at €20/month (billed annually) for 2,500 executions. The Pro plan starts at €50/month (billed annually) with higher limits and unlimited workflows.

n8n’s real cost advantage comes from self-hosting: the software is free and you can run unlimited executions. But “free” still requires a VPS ($10–40/month), Docker or server setup skills, ongoing maintenance, backups, and security updates. If the phrase “Docker deployment” means nothing to you, it’s not free — it’s inaccessible.

Table: Pricing Comparison at a Glance
Feature|Make.com|n8n Cloud|n8n Self-Hosted
Entry price|Free (1,000 operations/mo)|Starts at €20/mo (billed annually) for 2,500 executions|$0 software + $10–40/mo hosting
Paid plan|Starts at $9/mo (10,000 operations)|Starts at €50/mo (billed annually)|Server costs only
Billing unit|Per operation (per step)|Per execution (per workflow run)|Unlimited
Active workflows|Unlimited on all plans|Limited on Starter, unlimited on Pro|Unlimited
Setup required|None — sign up and build|None — sign up and build|VPS, Docker, backups, maintenance

CTA: If you’re unsure, the simplest test is to build one workflow on Make.com’s free plan. If you can get it running in under 30 minutes, you’ve found your tool.

H2: Ease of Use — Where the Gap Is Biggest

Make.com’s drag-and-drop scenario builder is designed for non-technical users. You search for an app, connect it with OAuth, and map data fields visually. If something breaks, you can see exactly where it failed and what data caused it.

n8n also has a visual editor, but the platform assumes more technical literacy. Connecting apps may involve API keys, webhook configuration, expressions, or interpreting developer-style error messages. n8n is generally more powerful for complex use cases — custom JavaScript, advanced looping, infrastructure control — but that power comes at the cost of accessibility.

H2: Same Workflow, Two Platforms — What It Actually Looks Like

Here’s what building the exact same automation looks like on each platform. The workflow: when someone books a Calendly call, add their details to Google Sheets and send a Slack notification to your team.

H3: On Make.com

You search for Calendly, choose a trigger like “Invitee Created,” authorize with OAuth, and select the event. Add a Google Sheets module, pick your spreadsheet from a dropdown, and map Name, Email, and Event Type visually. Add Slack, choose your channel, and write a message with mapped fields. Total time: 20–30 minutes. No code, no server setup, no terminal commands.

H3: On n8n

You add a Calendly trigger node and configure the connection (depending on the setup, this may involve webhook configuration). Then add a Google Sheets node and map fields using n8n expressions. Add Slack, authenticate via OAuth or API token, and configure the message. If something fails, you’ll likely troubleshoot using logs or developer-style error messages. Total time: 45–90 minutes if you’re comfortable with the concepts — significantly longer if you’re not.

Both platforms can produce the same result. The difference is who can build it without help.

H2: Integrations — Quantity vs. Flexibility

Make.com offers 2,400+ integrations with pre-built modules designed for quick setup without API knowledge.

n8n offers hundreds of native integrations and also makes it easy to connect to any API via HTTP Request nodes. For developers, this is a feature. For non-technical users, it can be a barrier.

If your workflow involves common business tools — Google Sheets, Slack, Gmail, Stripe, Calendly, Facebook Ads, CRMs — both platforms can handle it. Make.com’s modules are generally easier to configure.

H2: Real Cost Comparison for Typical Small Business Workflows

To make this concrete, here’s what a typical small business automation setup costs on each platform — assuming you’re not self-hosting n8n. These are estimates based on typical workflow structures.

Table: Monthly Cost for 3 Common Workflows (Estimates)
Scenario|Make.com Operations|n8n Executions|Make.com Cost|n8n Cloud Cost
Calendly booking → Google Sheets + Slack (100 bookings/mo)|400|100|$9/mo (Core)|Starts at €20/mo (Starter, billed annually)
Facebook leads → Google Sheets (200 leads/mo)|800|200|$9/mo (Core)|Starts at €20/mo (Starter, billed annually)
Stripe failed payment → Email + Slack (50 events/mo)|150|50|$9/mo (Core)|Starts at €20/mo (Starter, billed annually)
All three combined|1,350|350|$9/mo (Core)|Starts at €20/mo (Starter, billed annually)

Make.com’s operation model means you pay per step, but the $9 Core plan absorbs typical small business volume comfortably. n8n’s execution model can be cheaper per run for complex workflows, but the cloud entry price is higher — and Starter plan limits can matter depending on your usage.

Tech Tip: The economics change at scale. If you run very high volume workflows and can self-host reliably, n8n can become significantly cheaper. For most small businesses processing a few hundred events per month, Make.com’s $9 Core plan is hard to beat for simplicity and time-to-value.

H2: When n8n Is the Better Choice

n8n is a strong choice if you have technical resources, need self-hosting for data control or compliance, want to build advanced custom logic (JavaScript, complex branching), or run high-volume workflows where self-hosting saves money.

H2: When Make.com Is the Better Choice

Make.com is a strong choice if you don’t have a developer, want to be up and running quickly without infrastructure, build standard workflows like lead capture, onboarding, notifications, and payment monitoring, or want cloud reliability without maintenance.

For freelancers, agencies, consultants, and small business owners who need automation to work reliably without becoming a second job, Make.com is the more practical path.

H2: How to Decide — Three Questions to Ask Yourself

First: do you have someone technical who can manage infrastructure and debug API-style errors? If yes, n8n gives you more control. If no, Make.com is the safer choice.

Second: do you need self-hosting? If yes, n8n is the clear option. Make.com is cloud-only.

Third: how fast do you need results? If you want a working automation today, Make.com usually gets you there faster.

Verdict: Both Make.com and n8n are capable automation platforms — the right choice depends on your technical comfort level and team setup. For non-technical small business owners, freelancers, and service teams who want to automate lead capture, client onboarding, payment follow-ups, and team notifications without hiring a developer, Make.com delivers the same outcomes with less friction and faster time to value. If you have developer resources and want maximum flexibility or self-hosting, n8n is worth the steeper learning curve. The best way to decide is to build one workflow on each platform. Make.com’s free plan gives you 1,000 operations per month; n8n offers a cloud trial. Build the same workflow and see which one fits how you work.

FAQ:
Q: Is n8n really free?
A: The self-hosted Community Edition is free software with unlimited executions — but you still need a server ($10–40/month), technical setup, and time for ongoing maintenance. n8n Cloud plans start at €20/month (billed annually).
Q: Can I switch from n8n to Make.com later?
A: Yes, but you’ll need to rebuild workflows manually. There’s no direct migration tool between platforms.
Q: Which is better for AI automations?
A: n8n generally offers deeper customization for technical users. Make.com has AI modules that are easier to use but less customizable.
Q: Does Make.com have a self-hosted option?
A: No. Make.com is cloud-only. If self-hosting is a hard requirement, n8n is the better option.
Q: How many automations can I run on Make.com’s free plan?
A: The free plan includes 1,000 operations per month. A typical 4-step workflow uses 4 operations per run, which is about 250 runs per month — enough to validate multiple workflows before upgrading.
