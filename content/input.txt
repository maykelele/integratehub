Title: Zapier Too Expensive? The Honest Alternative for Small Business (Make.com Review)
Type: comparison

Introduction: If you're paying $50–$100 a month for Zapier and quietly wondering whether you're getting your money's worth, you're not alone. This guide won't tell you to cancel Zapier immediately — it will give you honest math so you can decide for yourself.

H2: Why Zapier Gets Expensive for Small Business

Zapier pricing is based on "tasks" — every individual action your automation performs counts as one task toward your monthly limit. On the surface, 2,000 tasks for $19.99/month sounds generous. The reality hits when you build a real workflow. A simple automation that receives a Facebook lead, adds it to Google Sheets, sends a Slack notification, and emails your sales team counts as 4 tasks — for a single lead. If you receive 200 leads per month, that's 800 tasks from one workflow alone. Most small businesses hit the ceiling within 60 days and upgrade to the $49/month Professional plan without fully understanding why.

H2: Make.com Pricing Explained (Simple Math)

Make.com charges for "operations" instead of tasks, but the key difference is pricing structure. The Core plan at $9/month includes 10,000 operations. The same Facebook lead workflow — 200 leads, 4 steps each — runs comfortably on Make.com Core with room for 5-6 additional automations of similar complexity. For a small business running 3-5 active workflows, the monthly difference is typically $30-70. Over 12 months that's $360-840 saved.

Table: Real Cost Comparison: Zapier vs Make.com
Workflow|Zapier Tasks/mo|Make Operations/mo|Zapier Cost|Make Cost
Facebook leads → Sheets → Slack → Email|800|800|$49/mo|$9/mo
Gmail → Drive + rename file|400|400|$49/mo|$9/mo
Calendly → Google Calendar + Slack alert|300|300|$49/mo|$9/mo
3 workflows combined|1,500|1,500|$49/mo|$9/mo

Tech Tip: Before switching, check your Zapier dashboard for "Tasks Used" in the current month. If you're consistently above 80% of your plan limit, Make.com will almost certainly cost you less for the same workflows.

H2: When Zapier Is Still the Better Choice

Zapier is not a bad product — stay on it if any of these apply. You use niche apps that Make.com doesn't support: Zapier connects 7,000+ apps versus Make.com's 2,400+. If your CRM or industry-specific software only has a Zapier integration, switching creates more problems than it solves. Your workflows are simple and your team built them — Make.com has a steeper learning curve and that comfort has real value. You're running fewer than 3 workflows and rarely hit task limits — the $30 monthly saving doesn't justify migration time.

H2: When Make.com Saves You Real Money

Make.com becomes the clear winner when you run multi-step workflows with 4+ actions, process high volumes of data, or want visual control over your workflows. Make.com's drag-and-drop scenario builder shows you exactly how data flows between apps — useful when something breaks and you need to debug quickly. If you're just starting out, Make.com's free plan includes 1,000 operations monthly — enough to validate 2-3 workflows before spending anything.

Workflow Steps: How to Switch from Zapier to Make.com in One Weekend
1. Log into Zapier and identify your highest-task workflow — the one consuming the most monthly tasks
2. Create a free Make.com account at make.com — no credit card required
3. Rebuild that one workflow in Make.com using the visual drag-and-drop builder
4. Run both Zapier and Make.com versions in parallel for one week
5. Confirm Make.com delivers identical results
6. Pause the Zapier version and monitor for two additional weeks
7. Once confident, migrate your remaining workflows one by one over 2-3 weekends

Verdict: Zapier is not a bad product — it's easier for beginners and connects 7,000+ apps. But if you're hitting task limits regularly and running workflows with 4+ steps, Make.com will almost certainly save you $360-840 per year for identical results. Rebuild one workflow on Make.com's free plan this weekend and see for yourself.

FAQ:
Q: Is Make.com cheaper than Zapier?
A: In most multi-step workflows, yes — typically 50-80% less per month. The biggest savings come when you have 4+ step workflows running at high volume.
Q: Is Make.com harder to use than Zapier?
A: Slightly at first. Zapier is more linear and beginner-friendly. Make.com has a visual canvas that becomes easier once you learn it — most users feel comfortable within a few days.
Q: Can Make.com replace Zapier completely?
A: For most small business workflows, yes. The only exception is if you rely on apps that Make.com doesn't support — check make.com/en/integrations before switching.
Q: What happens to my Zapier automations if I switch?
A: Nothing — they keep running until you manually pause them. You can migrate one workflow at a time and run both platforms in parallel during the transition.

Title: How to Automatically Send Facebook and Instagram Leads to Google Sheets
Type: how-to

Introduction: Every time someone fills out your Facebook or Instagram lead ad form, that lead sits in Meta's system waiting for you to manually download a CSV. By the time you respond, your competitor already called them. This guide shows how to get every new lead into Google Sheets automatically — in real time, no CSV downloads, no manual work.

H2: Why Manual Lead Export Is Killing Your Conversion Rate

Speed to lead is the single biggest factor in converting paid ad leads. Most businesses respond within 2-24 hours because they check Meta's Lead Center manually once or twice a day. Research consistently shows that responding within 5 minutes makes you 9x more likely to convert a lead than responding within an hour. When you're paying $5-20 per lead on Facebook or Instagram ads, slow follow-up is the most expensive mistake you can make.

H2: What This Automation Does

Every time someone submits your Facebook or Instagram lead ad form, Make.com instantly catches that event and adds a new row to your Google Sheet — name, email, phone number, and the ad name so you know which campaign generated the lead. Your sales team sees it in real time. No downloading, no importing, no delay.

Table: What Gets Captured Automatically
Form Field|Google Sheets Column|Example Value
First Name + Last Name|A: Name|Sarah Johnson
Email Address|B: Email|sarah@company.com
Phone Number|C: Phone|+1 555 0123
Ad Name|D: Source|Summer Promo 2026
Submission Time|E: Date|2026-02-20

Tech Tip: Add a Slack notification as a third step in Make.com — when a new row hits your Google Sheet, Slack pings your sales channel instantly. Response time drops from hours to minutes — and that directly impacts your conversion rate.

Workflow Steps: How to Connect Facebook Lead Ads to Google Sheets
1. Create a free Make.com account — no credit card required. Click "Create a new scenario" on your dashboard.
2. Click the large purple + button on the canvas and search for "Facebook Lead Ads" — select "Watch Leads" as your trigger

Image: assets/screenshots/screenshot-facebook-leads-2.png|Facebook Lead Ads module — click Create a connection to link your Facebook account

3. Click "Create a connection", name it anything (e.g. "My Facebook connection"), click Save — Facebook OAuth will open automatically
4. Once connected, select your Facebook Page and the Lead Ad Form you want to watch

Image: assets/screenshots/screenshot-facebook-leads-3.png|Facebook Lead Ads configuration — Connection and Page selection

5. Click the + button on the right of the Facebook module to add a second module — search for "Google Sheets" and select "Add a Row"
6. Connect your Google account and select the spreadsheet where leads should land — choose "Search by path" and select your file

7. Map the fields from Facebook to your Sheet columns — drag Full name to Name column, Email to Email column, Phone number to Phone column, Ad name to Source column, Date created to Date column

Image: assets/screenshots/screenshot-facebook-leads-5.png|Field mapping — Facebook lead data mapped to Google Sheets columns

8. Click Save — Make.com will ask "From which point do you want to start?" — select "From now on" to capture only new leads going forward
9. Click "Run once" to activate, then turn the scenario ON — the toggle at the bottom of the canvas

Verdict: If you're spending money on Facebook or Instagram ads and still downloading leads manually, you're paying twice — once for the lead and again in lost conversions from slow follow-up. This automation takes 20 minutes to set up once and runs forever. Make.com's free plan covers up to 1,000 operations per month, enough for most small businesses running lead gen campaigns. When you scale, the Core plan at $9/month handles thousands of leads.

FAQ:
Q: Does this work with Instagram lead ads too?
A: Yes — Facebook and Instagram lead ads share the same Meta Ads infrastructure. The Facebook Lead Ads module in Make.com captures leads from both platforms automatically.
Q: What if someone submits a lead while Make.com is not running?
A: Make.com checks for new leads on a schedule — every 15 minutes on the free plan, in real time on paid plans. Leads submitted between checks are queued and processed on the next run, nothing is lost.
Q: Do I need a developer to set this up?
A: No. Make.com's visual drag-and-drop builder requires no coding. If you can use Google Sheets, you can build this automation.
Q: What does "From now on" mean when setting up the trigger?
A: Make.com asks from which point to start processing leads. "From now on" means only new leads submitted after you activate the scenario will be captured. Choose "All" only if you want to import existing leads retroactively.

Slug: stripe-payment-failed-automation
Title: Stripe Payment Failed? Automatically Alert Your Team and Email the Customer Instantly
Type: how-to

Introduction: A payment fails in Stripe. The customer never hears from you. Two days later they cancel. This happens constantly — because Stripe logs the failure and moves on, and nobody is watching the dashboard 24/7. This guide shows you how to build an automation that reacts the moment a payment fails: the customer gets an email within seconds, and your team gets an alert. No developer needed, no manual checking.

H2: Why Missed Failed Payments Cost You More Than You Think

Every failed payment that goes unaddressed is a potential churn. Customers don't always know their card failed — they assume you'll reach out. When you don't, they assume the worst and move on. Speed matters: a same-day email from you reads as professional and attentive. A silence that lasts three days reads as a company that doesn't care. The good news is this is completely fixable with a simple automation. Once it's set up, it runs forever.

H2: Doesn't Stripe Already Send Failed Payment Emails?

Yes — but with important limitations that make it the wrong solution for most businesses. Stripe's built-in Smart Retries and dunning emails only work for subscription billing (recurring charges). If you send one-time invoices, Stripe won't automatically email your customer at all. Even for subscriptions, the emails are generic Stripe-branded messages that many customers confuse with spam or phishing. You can't add your logo, your tone, or a direct link to update payment details in your own portal. And critically — your team gets no alert. Nobody on your side knows a payment failed unless they check the Stripe dashboard manually. The automation in this guide solves all of that: it works for every invoice type, sends email from your own Gmail account, and notifies your team the same second it fires.

H2: What This Automation Does

When a payment fails in Stripe, Make.com catches the event instantly and runs three actions automatically: it identifies the customer, sends them a personalized email with their invoice details, and your team can add a Slack alert so someone can follow up if needed.

Table: How the Workflow Runs
Step|What Happens|Tool
1|Stripe detects a failed invoice payment|Stripe Webhook
2|Make.com retrieves the customer name and email|Stripe Retrieve a Customer
3|Customer receives a personalized email with invoice details|Gmail

The whole setup takes about 20 minutes. After that, it runs on its own.

Workflow Steps: How to Set Up the Automation

1. Create a Stripe account and add a test customer — open Stripe, go to Billing → Invoices, and create a test invoice. You'll use Stripe's sandbox mode throughout this guide, so no real payments are involved.

2. Log in to Make.com and create a new scenario — click the large + button on the canvas and search for "Stripe." Select the Watch Events module. This is the trigger that listens to your Stripe account.

Image: assets/screenshots/screenshot-stripe-reminders-2.png|Make.com scenario canvas with the Stripe Watch Events module and Create a webhook button

3. Click "Create a webhook" — Make.com will ask you to connect your Stripe account. Use API Key authentication: copy your Secret key from Stripe → Developers → API keys (it starts with sk_test_ for sandbox). Set the Group to "Invoice" and check "Invoice payment failed" as the event to watch.

Image: assets/screenshots/screenshot-stripe-reminders-3.png|Webhook configuration showing Invoice group with Invoice payment failed event selected

4. Add a filter between your Stripe trigger and the next module — click the line between modules and select "Add a filter." Set the label to "Invoice Payment Failed," the condition to Event Type, the operator to Equal to, and the value to invoice.payment_failed. This prevents the workflow from running on unrelated Stripe events.

5. Add a Stripe "Retrieve a Customer" module — click the + button and search for Stripe again. Select "Retrieve a Customer." This step is essential: when Stripe sends a payment failed event, it includes the customer's ID but not their name or email. This module fetches the full customer profile.

6. Map the Customer ID field to the customer object from your Stripe trigger — in the Retrieve a Customer configuration, set Customer ID to "2. Object: Customer" from the previous module. This tells Make.com which customer to look up.

Image: assets/screenshots/screenshot-stripe-reminders-6.png|Retrieve a Customer module with Customer ID mapped to the Stripe event data

7. Add a Gmail "Send an email" module — click + and add Gmail. Connect your Google account when prompted. Map the To field to "7. Email" from the Retrieve a Customer module. For the Subject, type "Payment Failed: Invoice" and then map "2. Object: Number" so each email shows the real invoice number.

Image: assets/screenshots/screenshot-stripe-reminders-7.png|Gmail module showing connection setup with To, Subject and Body fields

8. Map the email body with dynamic fields — in the Body field, write your message and map three fields from Stripe: the customer's name (7. Name), the invoice amount (2. Object: Amount due), and the invoice number (2. Object: Number). The result is a personalized email that looks like it was written by hand.

Image: assets/screenshots/screenshot-stripe-reminders-9.png|Gmail body showing dynamic fields mapped — customer name, payment amount, and invoice number

9. Save the scenario — your canvas should now show three modules connected: Stripe Watch Events → Stripe Retrieve a Customer → Gmail Send an email.

Image: assets/screenshots/screenshot-stripe-reminders-10.png|Complete Make.com scenario canvas showing all three modules connected

10. Test the workflow — use the Stripe CLI to send a test event without touching any real data. Run stripe trigger invoice.payment_failed in your terminal. Make.com will process it and send the email to your test customer automatically. If you don't have the Stripe CLI, install it with brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe on Mac, then run stripe login first.

Tech Tip: After the Gmail module, add a Slack "Create a Message" module to alert your billing channel the moment a payment fails. Something like: "Payment failed — [Customer Name], Invoice [Number], Amount: [Amount Due]. Follow up today." Now both the customer and your team know immediately — and someone can pick up the phone if the customer doesn't respond to the automated email.

Verdict: Failed payments are one of the most preventable forms of revenue loss for small businesses. Stripe's built-in emails only cover subscriptions and arrive as generic Stripe-branded messages — this automation works for every invoice type, sends email from your own account, and alerts your team in the same instant. It takes under 30 minutes to build and runs forever without maintenance.

FAQ:
Q: Do I need a paid Stripe account to set this up?
A: No. You can build and test the entire workflow using Stripe's sandbox mode, which is free. When you're ready to go live, switch to your live Stripe API key and the automation works identically.
Q: What if the same payment fails multiple times?
A: Stripe sends a new event each time a payment attempt fails. Your Make.com scenario will fire each time, sending a new email. If you want to limit notifications to one per invoice, add a Make.com data store to track which invoices have already triggered an alert.
Q: Does this work for subscription renewals, not just one-time invoices?
A: Yes. The invoice.payment_failed event covers both subscription renewals and one-time invoice payments. Any failed charge that generates a Stripe invoice will trigger this workflow.
Q: Do I need a paid Make.com plan?
A: The free Make.com plan includes 1,000 operations per month. Each time this scenario runs, it uses 3 operations — one per module. For most small businesses, the free plan is more than enough to get started.
